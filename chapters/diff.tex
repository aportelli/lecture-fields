Many physical quantities vary in some region of space,~\emph{e.g.} the temperature
$T(\v{r})$ of a body. To study this we require the concept of a physical \emph{field}.

If to each point $\v{r}$ in some region of space there corresponds a \emph{scalar}
$\phi(x_1,x_2,x_3)$, then $\phi(\v{r})$ is a \emph{scalar field}.

\emph{Examples:} temperature distribution in a body $T(\v{r})$,
pressure in the atmosphere $p(\v{r})$, electric charge density or mass
density $\rho(\v{r})$, electrostatic potential $\phi(\v{r})$.

Similarly a \emph{vector field} assigns a vector $\v{v}(\v{r})$ to each point $\v{r}$ of
some region.

\emph{Examples:} velocity in a fluid $\v{v}(\v{r})$, electric current
density $\v{j}(\v{r})$, electric field $\vE(\v{r})$, magnetic field
$\vB(\v{r})$ (actually a pseudovector field).

A vector field in 2-d can be represented graphically, at a carefully selected set of
points $\v{r}$, by an arrow whose length and direction is proportional to $\v{v}(\v{r})$
\eg wind velocity on a weather forecast chart.
