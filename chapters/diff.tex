Many physical quantities vary in some region of space,~\emph{e.g.} the temperature
$T(\v{r})$ of a body. To study this we require the concept of a physical \emph{field}. If
to each point with position vector $\v{r}=(x_1,x_2,x_3)$ in some region of space there
corresponds a \emph{scalar} $\phi(\v{r})=\phi(x_1,x_2,x_3)$, then $\phi$ is a
\emph{scalar field}. \medskip

\noindent\emph{Examples:} temperature distribution in a body $T(\v{r})$, pressure in the
atmosphere $p(\v{r})$, electric charge density or mass density $\rho(\v{r})$,
electrostatic potential $\phi(\v{r})$.\medskip

\noindent Similarly, a \emph{vector field} assigns a vector $\v{v}(\v{r})$ to each
point $\v{r}$ of
some region. \medskip

\noindent\emph{Examples:} velocity in a fluid $\v{v}(\v{r})$, electric current
density $\v{j}(\v{r})$, electric field $\vE(\v{r})$, magnetic field
$\vB(\v{r})$ (actually a pseudovector field).\medskip

\noindent A vector field in two dimensions can be represented graphically, at a carefully
selected set of points $\v{r}$, by an arrow whose length and direction is proportional
to $\v{v}(\v{r})$ \eg wind velocity on a weather forecast chart.
