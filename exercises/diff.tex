  \Exercise Describe the level surfaces (equipotentials) and calculate
  the gradient $\grad f$ for the following real scalar fields.\\
  \textit{Hint: for part 3 you may find helpful to consider $\cos(f)$.}
  \Question $f(\vr) = x+2y-3z$
  \Question $f(\vr) = (x^{2}+y^{2})^{-1}$
  \Question $f(\vr) = \cos^{-1}(x^{2}+y^{2}-z)$

  \Exercise
  Calculate $\grad f$ and describe the level surfaces for each of
  following fields (the vector $\v{a}$ is constant)\\
  \textit{Hint for last two: choose the basis such that vector $\v{a}$
    is in $\v{e}_3$ direction when describing the level surfaces.}
  \Question $f(\vr) = \v{a}\cdot\v{r}$
  \Question $f(\vr) = |\v{r}-\v{a}|$
  \Question $f(\vr) = |\v{r}-\v{a}|^{-1}$
  \Question $f(\vr) = (\v{a}\times\v{r})^{2}$
  \Question $f(\vr) = \v{a}\cdot\v{r} / r^2$
